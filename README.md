## Overview:
ResQsense is an integrated hazard detection and safety management solution designed for modern mining operations. By combining advanced sensor technologies, robust IoT connectivity, and AI-driven analytics, ResQsense continuously monitors critical environmental and operational parameters in real time. This system enhances safety, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance by complementing traditional manual inspections with automated data collection and predictive risk assessments.

Engineered for seamless integration into existing mining workflows, ResQsense provides a comprehensive platform for managing hazards, safeguarding personnel, and supporting sustainable mining practices. Its built-in self-fault detection feature automatically identifies potential system issues, eliminating the need for manual testing.

## Current Problems Addressed:
ResQsense is developed to tackle several critical challenges in modern mining operations:

- **Delayed Hazard Detection:** Traditional systems often fail to detect risks such as gas leaks, fires, or structural issues in real time.
- **Lack of Integration:** Existing rescue and safety devices operate in isolation, which reduces overall emergency response efficiency.
- **Unidentified Equipment Failures:** Machines and sensors may fail without warning, leading to unexpected downtimes and safety hazards.
- **Slow Decision-Making:** The absence of edge computing leads to delays in data processing and response actions.
- **Limited Data Insights:** Without a centralized analytics dashboard, organizations struggle to make data-driven safety decisions.
- **Inefficient Monitoring:** There is no unified system to track multiple hazards (pressure, gas, temperature, vibration, flame, sound, current, tilt) in real time.
- **Poor Fault Diagnosis:** Diagnosing the causes of failures in safety equipment is often time-consuming and complex.
- **Data Loss & Accessibility Issues:** Lack of proper data storage and real-time access hampers long-term safety analysis and compliance tracking.
